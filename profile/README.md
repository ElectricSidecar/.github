# Welcome to the Electric Sidecar community

Electric Sidecar is an app and community built around providing peace of mind to vehicle owners. Whether you're experiencing an issue with a car you own, or are considering a car purchase, the Electric Sidecar community is a great place to get informed.

*Join the beta via https://electricsidecar.app.*

## Getting involved

The Electric Sidecar community on GitHub is organized around vehicle makes and models. If there isn't yet [a repository](https://github.com/orgs/ElectricSidecar/repositories) for your vehicle's make and model, please [request it](https://github.com/ElectricSidecar/.github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=new-make-and-model.md&title=%5BMake%5D+Model).

If you've encountered an issue with your vehicle please consider submitting it as a new issue on your vehice's repository, or adding a comment / emoji to an existing issue.

### Get the app

While it's possible to interact with the Electric Sidecar community entirely through GitHub, the best way to access the community content is through [the Electric Sidecar app](https://electricsidecar.app). Currently available for iPhone and Apple Watch, the Electric Sidecar app makes it easy to browse existing issues and submit new ones.
