# Welcome to the Sidecar community

Sidecar is an app and [community forum](https://cars.forum) built for pepole who have cars.

## Getting involved

Browsing the community content doesn't require any kind of account, but if you want to contribute then you'll need a GitHub account ([signing up is easy!](https://github.com/signup)).

The Sidecar community on GitHub is organized around vehicle makes and models. If there isn't yet [a repository](https://github.com/orgs/ElectricSidecar/repositories) for your vehicle's make and model, please [request it](https://github.com/ElectricSidecar/meta/issues/new?assignees=jverkoey&labels=new-vehicle&projects=&template=new-make-and-model.md&title=%5Bmake%5D+model).

### Get the app

While it's possible to interact with the Sidecar community entirely through GitHub, the best way to make use of the community content is through [the Sidecar app](https://sidecar.clutch.engineering). Currently available for iPhone and Apple Watch, Sidecar is an all-in-one vehicle product.
